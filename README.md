# NumNetwork-FashionMnist

A neural network implementation for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
This model uses two layers (and can be expanded) with ReLU and softmax activations, and employs functions for forward and backward propagation, parameter updates, and training with gradient descent.

The objective of this project was to learn how to structure a simple neural network without the use of Pytorch / Keras or other ML libraries. 


### Data source
The test and train data are from the Fashion MNIST dataset found on kaggle (here)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist]. 
To comply with Github's policy on large files, I divided the train dataset in 2 pieces, which are merged instantly.


### Dependencies and download

Numpy == 1.26.3
Pandas == 2.1.4
